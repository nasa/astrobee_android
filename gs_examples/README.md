# Astrobee gs examples

## test simple trajectory

This is a guest science android application that uses the guest science 
library and the Astrobee API. It is an example of a primary apk that commands 
the robot to execute a simple trajectory. 
Please look at the [readme file](/gs_examples/test_simple_trajectory/readme.md) 
inside the app directory for further information.

## battery monitor

This is a guest science android application that uses the guest science 
library and simple ROS communications to get data from the batteries. It is 
also an example of a secondary apk that has a GUI. While GUIs are useful in 
testing, most GS apks shouldn't have a GUI since a crew member will most 
likely not be looking at it. 
Please, look at the [readme file](/gs_examples/battery_monitor/readme.md) 
inside the app directory for further information.

## test gs api

This is a guest science android application that uses the guest science 
library and the Astrobee API. It is also an example of a primary apk that 
commands the robot to execute trajectories and move the arm. 
Please look at the [readme file](/gs_examples/test_gs_api/readme.md) 
inside the app directory for further information.

## java test square trajectory

This is a guest science example that uses the astrobee api but not the guest 
science library. This example moves the astrobee in a rectangle. 
Please look at the [readme file](/gs_examples/java_test_square_trajectory/readme.md) 
inside the app directory for further information.

## test guest science apk

This is a guest science apk example that uses the guest science library but 
not the astrobee api. It is an example of a primary apk that has a GUI. While 
GUIs are useful in testing, most GS apks shouldn't have a GUI since a crew 
member will most likely not be looking at the GUI.

## test rfid reader

This is a guest science apk example that uses the guest science library but 
not the astrobee api. It is an example of a primary apk that simulates a fake 
rfid reader.

## test air sample
